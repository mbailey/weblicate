= weblicate

Replicate a website.

Weblicate creates a copy of a web page, complete with third party assets, to be run on your own webserver.
When given a HAR file, weblicate writes all assets to local disk. It appends a domain to the end of all
URLs so you can simulate external requests from sites like doubleclick and google.

== Installation

You need Ruby and RubyGems installed
 
  sudo gem install weblicate

== Usage

Running the following command:

  weblicate www.cnn.com.har usa.weblicate.info

generates the following output:

  files-usa.weblicate.info   # All files and assets for the page
  hosts-usa.weblicate.info   # Entries that can be added to your local hosts file

You also get these if you want the outside world to be able to see your weblicant:

  dns-usa.weblicate.info     # A script to create DNS entries (on Slicehost.com)
  vhosts-usa.weblicate.info  # Apache vhosts entries for all domains
